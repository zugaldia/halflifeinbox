<p>To clean up your inbox, follow the schedule below. At the end of each day, you see the number of emails you need to leave in your inbox. That means you need to take care of <em>both existing emails and incoming emails</em>.</p>

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table table-striped">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>&nbsp;</th>
				<th>&nbsp;</th>
				<th>Date</th>
				<th>Number of emails in your inbox</th>
			</tr>
			<tr ng-repeat="entry in emailPlan">
				<td>Day {{ entry.day }}</td>
				<td>
					<div ng-show="entry.day===0">
						Today</div>
					<div ng-show="entry.day===halfLife">
						Half-life
						<span class="fui-arrow-right text-primary"></span></div>
					<div ng-show="entry.day===emailPlan.length-1">
						Done!
					</div>
				</td>
				<td>{{ entry.expectedDate }}</td>
				<td>{{ entry.remaining }} emails</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
	<p>You need to stick to a decay rate of {{ decayRate }}/day.</p>
	<p>This gives you a <strong>half-life of {{ halfLife }} days</strong> &mdash;
	that's the number of days you need to bring your inbox to half of its initial size ({{ firstDay }} emails).</p>

<h6>The hypothesis</h6>

<ol>
	<li>You go on vacation, you focus in a project, and when you come back your inbox has exploded.</li>
	<li>At the beginning, it's easier to clean up messages
		(newsletters, outdated notifications, stuff you're in CC).
		Then it gets harder (emails you actually need to think and type, emails you can only answer).</li>
	<li>Inbox Zero is a good thing, but it's unrealistic.
		There's always a minimum amount of emails flowing in your inbox.</li>
	<li>While you catch up with old email, you still receive new emails.
		However, you can manage both at the same time.</li>
	<li>To catch up, it helps having a deadline.</li>
</ol>

<h6>The solution</h6>

<p>
We follow an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay">exponential decay model</a>
to solve the problem. Check out the Wikipedia chart to get a visual idea.

Who knew, the same rules governing Chemical reactions, Electrostatics, Fluid Dynamics, Geophysics,
Heat transfer, Luminescence, Pharmacology and toxicology, Physical optics, Radioactivity,
Thermoelectricity, or Vibrations may apply to inboxes as well.
